# DATASET LOADING & CHECKING #
##############################

data <- read.csv("./Prostate_Cancer.csv") # We read the dataset from the csv file

head(data) # We visualize the first six rows of the dataset

str(data) # We visualize the structure of the data (the different variables, their type, and some initial values)

# VARIABLE SELECTION & CONTINGENCY TABLE #
##########################################

# To perform correspondence analysis, we need to create new variables that are fit for it.
# To do this, we will select variables from our original dataset and transform them into categorical
# variables that can be used in correspondence analysis.
# As to how this will be done, we will select 2 variables, perimeter and smoothness then we will transform
# these variables into levels ("low", "medium", and "high"), which will be achieved by using what we have
# determined to be a reasonable method to separate those categories, that method uses the standard
# deviation of the data for the column and separating at the point where 1 standard deviation is reached on
# the low and high ends of the data, giving us "low" for everything below -1 standard deviation, "normal"
# for everything between -1 and 1 standard deviations, and "high" for everything above 1 standard deviation

# We select the 2 variables from the dataset
sdata <- data[, c("smoothness", "perimeter")]
sdata

# We create a function to transform the values into levels
toLevels <- function(x) {
  u <- mean(x)
  o <- sd(x)
  result <- ifelse(x < u - o, "low", ifelse(x > u + o, "high", "normal"))
  return(result)
}

# We apply the function
sdata2 <- as.data.frame(lapply(sdata, toLevels))
sdata2

# We have successfully transformed the values into levels, now we will count each of those values
# to transform them into categorical values and create a contingency table.

cadata <- table(sdata2$smoothness, sdata2$perimeter)

# Change column & row names
colnames(cadata) <- c("smoothness_low", "smoothness_normal", "smoothness_high")
rownames(cadata) <- c("perimeter_low", "perimeter_normal", "perimeter_high")

# CHI-SQUARE TEST #
###################

# Remember, in this test, we check whether the data is different from the independence model.
# If the data is similar to the independence model, variables are independent, and the opposite
x2test<-chisq.test(cadata)

# The expected values given by the independent model are:
round(x2test$expected,0)
# The observed values are:
x2test$observed
# We can see that there is a considerable difference.

# Is the difference big enough?
# Let's compute the p-value:
p.val <- x2test$p.value
p.val
# The p-value is quite large, thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the independence
# model can explain the data. Therefore, the variables are independent.

# This is the contribution of each cell to the chi-square
x2test$residuals^2
# And this is the relative contribution
(x2test$residuals^2)/x2test$statistic

###########################
# ROW AND COLUMN PROFILES #
###########################

# Let us now compute the row and col profiles

# Row profiles
dd <- rbind(cadata,apply(cadata[,1: nrow(cadata)],2,sum))
rownames(dd)[nrow(cadata) + 1] <- "Mean profile"
round(prop.table(as.matrix(dd),margin=1),2)

# Col profiles
dd <- cbind(cadata,apply(cadata[,1: ncol(cadata)],1,sum))
colnames(dd)[ncol(cadata) + 1] <- "Mean profile"
round(prop.table(as.matrix(dd),margin=2),2)

###########
# FULL CA #
###########

# The function to perform Correspondence Analysis is simply CA
cawom <- CA(cadata)

# We visualize both row and column profiles by 
plot(cawom)

# One can visualize only the rows or only the columns with
plot(cawom,invisible="col")
plot(cawom,invisible="row")

# The main indicators can be obtained with
summary(cawom)
