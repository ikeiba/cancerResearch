summary(pca_result)

# We visualize the scree plot
scree_all <- fviz_eig(pca_result, main = "All Variables", addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 100)) # Create plot for all

# We check the eigenvalues as well (we take into account that if the eigenvalue is lower
# than 1, is not "improving" a original variable, so it will probably not be worth 
# including it).
pca_result$eig # Only eigenvalues of components 1 and 2 are above 1 representing 63% of the data

# In this case, as we can see at the 'elbow' in the 
# plot we can see that it is at dimesions 3. This is beacause percentage of explained 
# variance drops by a half from component 2 to component 3, and the curve starts (slowly) 
# to flatten out afterwards. 
# In this case we will consider the first two components, as there is a significant 
# difference between the percentage of variance explained by them and the percentage 
# explained by the following components. The first two components sum up to explain 
# approximately 63% of the variance of the data.

# PCA: CORRELATIONS WITH VARIABLES #
####################################

# We check the correlations of the original variables with the selected components:

pca_result$var$coord[ , 1:2] # The first component shows stronger correlations with more variables 
# compared to the second component, however, the difference between the two components is not very 
# pronounced. This is not surprising, given that the first component accounts for 37% of the
# total variance, whereas the second explains 26% resulting in a difference of only 11%.

# High correlations (|correlation| > 0.8):

# Component 1: compactness, but perimeter and symmetry are near (both 0.71 approximately)

# Component 2: although there is no parameter in this component with a cor > 0.8, the area
# and the fractal_dimension are near (-0.74 and 0.78 respectively)

## Individual Coordinates

# We start by checking the individual coordinates in the first two dimensions (this is,
# taking into account the first two components)

# the individuals

## Duality

# Duality is for checking the relation between a variable and a specific individual:

# When an individual point is located in the direction of a variable arrow, 
# the individual has a high value on that variable. If it is in the opposite direction,
# it will have a low value. 

# The distance is also important: the farther along the line an individual is, 
# the larger their value for that variable and viceversa.


# For the full model:

# Create the scatter plot with vectors
