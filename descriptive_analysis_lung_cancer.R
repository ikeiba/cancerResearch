# DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LUNG CANCER DATASET 
# Authors: Iker Ibarrola, Enetz Quindimil, Carlos Firvida, IÃ±igo Infante

# Description of the dataset:
# The lung cancer dataset is synthetically generated. However, the description 
# indicates that it is designed to closely mirror real-world scenarios, making it 
# suitable for predictive modeling.


# First of all, we load the libraries we are going to use to perform the analysis
library(dplyr)
library(pastecs)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(car)

###################################
# START
# We read the dataset from the csv file
data <- read.csv("./lung_cancer_data.csv")

# We get some general information from the dataset, ensuring that everything has been loaded correctly
head(data) # We visualize the first six rows of the dataset

str(data) # We visualize the structure of the data (the different variables, their type and some initial values)

# After this two first steps, we detect that there is a variable called Patient_ID, which will not be useful for us
data <- data %>% select(-Patient_ID) # We remove Patient_ID

# We check the dimensions of the dataset (23658 rows and 37 columns)
dim(data) 

# Now we get the numerical summary for some variable(s)
summary(data) #[,] # We can add the [] to select specific variables

# After performing this analysis, we did not detected any particular thing that might be wrong with the data.

# The variable Gender, Comorbidity_Diabetes, Comorbidity_Hypertension,
# Comorbidity_Heart_Disease, Comorbidity_Chronic_Lung_Disease, Comorbidity_Kidney_Disease,
# Comorbidity_Autoimmune_Disease, Comorbidity_Other are categorical (binary). So we will create a factor from it:
data$Gender <- factor(data$Gender)
data[,12] <- factor(data[,12])
data[,13] <- factor(data[,13])
data[,14] <- factor(data[,14])
data[,15] <- factor(data[,15])
data[,16] <- factor(data[,16])
data[,17] <- factor(data[,17])
data[,18] <- factor(data[,18])

# We check that know the data is interpreted as a factor rather than a simple string
summary(data$Gender)   # There are 1174 female cases and 11924 male
summary(data[,12])     # There are 11897 with comorbidity diabetes and 11761 who do not have
summary(data[,13])     # There are 11798 with comorbidity hypertension and 11860 who do not have
summary(data[,14])     # There are 11915 with comorbidity heart disease and 11743 who do not have
summary(data[,15])     # There are 11780 with comorbidity chronic lung disease and 11878 who do not have
summary(data[,16])     # There are 11921 with comorbidity kidney disease and 11737 who do not have
summary(data[,17])     # There are 11845 with comorbidity autoimmune disease and 11813 who do not have
summary(data[,18])     # There are 11882 with other type of comorbidity and 11776 who do not have

# We are going to check as well for the existence of na observations (missing values)
colSums(is.na(data)) # There are no missing values

# We could use this function as well to check for some descriptive statistics and missing values
stat.desc(data)

###################################
# Metrics such as minimum, maximum, median, mean and 1st and 3rd quartiles are already computed with the summary() function
# However, if at any moment we would like to compute each of them separately, we could do it in the following way:
# *we have omitted the na.rm=TRUE parameter as we have previously checked that there are no missing values
variable_to_analyse <- data$Hemoglobin_Level

min(variable_to_analyse)
max(variable_to_analyse)
median(variable_to_analyse)
mean(variable_to_analyse)
quantile(variable_to_analyse, 0.25) # First quartile 
quantile(variable_to_analyse, 0.75) # Third quartile

# Additionally, we could compute some other metrics (we haven't include the mode as the variables are continuous)
range(variable_to_analyse) # Range of the variable
quantile(variable_to_analyse, 0.4) # Any percentile of the variable
IQR(variable_to_analyse) # Interquartile range (this would be later visualize via boxplots)
sd(variable_to_analyse) # Standard deviation
var(variable_to_analyse) # Variance

# In case we would want to use one of this functions over a subset of variables:
subset_to_analyse <- data[, 1:37] # Select the subset you want
lapply(subset_to_analyse, mean) # Modify the second parameter for whatever function you want

###################################
# Correlation
# In this step we will do a deeper analysis of our variables: 

cor(data$Tumor_Size_mm, data$Smoking_Pack_Years)     # We look if there is a correlation between the size of the tumour and the smoking years of the patient     
cor(data$Tumor_Size_mm, data$Survival_Months)     # We look if there is a correlation between the tumor size and the survival months
cor(data$Hemoglobin_Level, data$Tumor_Size_mm)     # We look if there is a correlation between the hemoglobin level and the tumour size
cor(data$Blood_Pressure_Systolic, data$Survival_Months)     # We look if there is a correlation between the blood pressure systolic and the survival months
cor(data$Blood_Pressure_Systolic, data$Blood_Pressure_Diastolic)     # We look if there is a correlation between the blood pressure systolic and the blood pressure diastolic

###################################
# Visualization
# To begin with the visualization, we will create the multiscatter plot for some variables. We just take some 
# observations because if we take all of them we start to have problems with the computer   
data_subset <- data[2:2000,20:30] 
numeric_df_means <- data_subset[, sapply(data_subset, is.numeric)]
pairs(numeric_df_means) 
# In most cases the correlation is very low, so we will try other analysis dividing the dat by some binary variable

# We continue by creating a histogram of radius_mean (in case you wanted to visualize
# another variable just change x = variable)
ggplot(data, aes(x = Tumor_Size_mm)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "blue") + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of Tumor Size") + 
  xlab("Tumor Size") + 
  ylab("Count")

# Now a boxplot of Tumor_Size_mm (in case you wanted to visualize another variable just change x = variable)
# we use the diagnosis in the x axis to see difference between gender
ggplot(data, aes(x = Gender , y = Tumor_Size_mm, fill = Gender)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Comparison of Tumor Size for Gender")

# We use the dotplot to visualize it in another way
dotplot(data$Tumor_Size_mm ~ data$Smoking_Pack_Years)

# Scatter plot of Tumor_Size_mm vs White_Blood_Cell_Count (by gender)
# In some cases we will just take a subset of observations, as taking all of them
# makes it more difficult to visualize relationships and overwhelms the visual representations.
ggplot(data[1:2000, ], aes(x = Tumor_Size_mm, y = White_Blood_Cell_Count, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Tumor_Size_mm vs White_Blood_Cell_Count")
# Another way of visualizing the same as above
ggplot(data[1:200, ], aes(x=Tumor_Size_mm, y=White_Blood_Cell_Count)) + geom_point(size=1) + facet_grid(.~Gender)

# Scatter plot of Blood_Pressure_Pulse vs Albumin_Level (by Stage)
ggplot(data[1:200, ], aes(x =Blood_Pressure_Pulse , y = Albumin_Level, color = Stage)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Blood_Pressure_Pulse vs Albumin_Level")
#Another way of visualizing the same as above
ggplot(data[1:200, ], aes(x=Blood_Pressure_Pulse, y=Albumin_Level)) + geom_point(size=1) + facet_grid(.~Stage)

# We continue by using the contingency table to check some information about categorical variables and proportions
# Gender
table(data$Gender)
prop.table(table(data$Gender))

# Stage
table(data$Stage)
prop.table(table(data$Stage))

# Smoking_History
table(data$Smoking_History)
prop.table(table(data$Smoking_History))

# Ethnicity
table(data$Ethnicity)
prop.table(table(data$Ethnicity))

# Insurance_Type
table(data$Insurance_Type)
prop.table(table(data$Insurance_Type))

# We can also do this with two qualitative variables
table(data$Gender,data$Smoking_History)
table(data$Stage,data$Smoking_History)

# And now we compute the proportions (with respect to all)
prop.table(table(data$Gender,data$Smoking_History))
prop.table(table(data$Stage,data$Smoking_History))

# We use a bar plot to visualize Gender
ggplot(data)+
  aes(Gender)+
  geom_bar()

# We end up by using the qq plot
qqPlot(data[1:200, ]$Tumor_Size_mm) # as there are a lot of points outside the region, the normal approximation does not work
