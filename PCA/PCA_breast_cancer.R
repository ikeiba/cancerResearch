# DATASET LOADING & CHECKING

# DATASET MODIFICATION
###################################

# We remove the variables that are not continuous:

#* Before removing it we will save the diagnosis in a variable, as it will be useful 
# at the end of the analysis
diagnosis <- as.factor(data$diagnosis)

# PCA: VARIABLE SELECTION
###################################

# Although our dataset has 30 continuous variables, they come from 10 different
# measurements, each having been measured in three different ways (mean, se & worst). 
# In that situation, we had the doubt whether to use all the variables or just a variable 
# for each measurement.

# After consulting with the professor, we have reached the conclusion that both approaches
# have their own positive and negative aspects: 

    # Using just a variable per measurement can lead to an easier interpretation of the 
    # results, as well as reducing noise introduced by variables that are extremely similar
    # or very highly correlated.
    
    # Using all the variables might be closer to a real-world scenario where we would use 
    # PCA, in which we have a higher number of variables and we want to reduce it.

# So, to see the difference between each approach, we will apply PCA with both cases (using
# just the variables measuring the mean and with all the variables)


# We select the variables that measure the means
mean_vars <- grep("_mean$", names(data), value = TRUE)
data_mean <- data[, mean_vars]

# We check that both data frames are correct:
head(data)
head(data_mean)

# PCA: COMPONENT SELECTION
###################################

# We apply the PCA using the PCA function
pca_all <- PCA(data, scale.unit = TRUE)
pca_mean <- PCA(data_mean, scale.unit = TRUE) 

# We visualize the summary, to check every section of PCA
summary(pca_all)
summary(pca_mean)


# We check the eigenvalues as well (we take into account that if the eigenvalue is lower
# than 1, is not "improving" a original variable, so it will probably not be worth 
# including it).
pca_all$eig # From Comp1 to Comp6 the eigenvalues are above 1
pca_mean$eig # Just in Comp1 and Comp 2 the eigenvalues are above 1 


# We visualize the scree plots
scree_all <- fviz_eig(pca_all, main = "All Variables", addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 100)) # Create plot for all
scree_mean <- fviz_eig(pca_mean, main = "'Mean' Variables", addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 100)) #Create plot for mean

scree_all + scree_mean # Visualize them side by side


# In the first case (the one with all the variables), when we look for the 'elbow' in the 
# plot we can see that it is at dimesions 3. This is beacause percentage of explained 
# variance drops by more than a half from component 2 to component 3, and the curve starts 
# to flatten out afterwards. 
# In this case we will consider the first two components, as there is a significant 
# difference between the percentage of variance explained by them and the percentage 
# explained by the following components. The first two components sum up to explain 
# approximately 63% of the variance of the data.
# Although this number could seem small, we have to take into account that we are reducing 
# the amount of variables from 30 to JUST 2, AND STILL KEEPING 63% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE.


# In the second case (the one with just the 'means'), when we look for the 'elbow' in the 
# plot we can see that it is at dimesions 3. In this case, it has been easier to detect
# as the percentage of explained variance drops by more than a third from component 2 
# to component 3, and the curve considerably flattens out afterwards. 
# In this case we will just consider the first two components, as they sum up to explain 
# approximately 80% of the variance of the data.


# COMPARISON: Just by looking at the percentage of variance explained by each component
# in the two distinct 'models' (full and means) we can see that there are some clear  
# differences: 

    # The 'main' components (first & second) of the 'means' model explain more variance
    # than the ones of the full model. 

    # To explain the same percentage of variance, we have to consider more components
    # from the full model than from the 'means' model.

# Does this make sense? YES:

    # As the full model is considering more variables, the explained variance spreads out
    # over more components, leading to a smaller percentage of variance explained by the
    # first components.

    # The 'means' model is more compact as it doesn't add as much noise or redundancy as
    # the full model does (we already knew this, as in the full model we where including
    # some variables that were very highly correlated).


###################################
# PCA: CORRELATIONS WITH VARIABLES
###################################

# We check the correlations of the original variables with the selected components:

# In the case of the full model, we obtain the following results:
pca_all$var$coord[ , 1:2] # We can see that the first component has high correlations
# with more variables than the second component does (this is something we could have  
# expected since the first component explains 44% of the total variance while the 
# second one just explains 19%). 

# High correlations (|correlation| > 0.8):

    # Component 1: perimeter_mean, area_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, 
    # concave.points_mean, perimeter_worst, area_worst, radius_worst, concavity_worst, 
    # concave.points_worst (10 variables, 33.33% of the total variables, but in most 
    # cases it includes different statistical summaries of the same measurement).

    # Component 2: fractal_dimension_mean (just 1 variable, 3.33% of the total variables)    


# In the case of the 'means' model, we obtain the following results:
pca_mean$var$coord[ , 1:2] # We can see that, as it happened with the full model, the 
# first component has high correlations with more variables than the second component 
# does (this is again something we could have expected since the first component explains 
# 55% of the total variance while the second one just explains 25%). 

# High correlations (|correlation| > 0.8): 

    # Component 1: radius_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, compactness_mean, 
    # concavity_mean, concave.points_mean (6 variables, 60% of the total variables, in
    # this case it is highly correlated with variables that are correlated between them, 
    # which makes sense).

    # Component 2: fractal_dimension_mean (just 1 variable, but 10% of the total variables)


# In conclusion, even though the full model is considering 20 variables more, the primary
# components of both models are highly correlated with almost the same variables (in the
# case of the second component it is exactly the same, and in the case of the first
# component, the full model just includes different statistical summaries of the same 
# measurements). This means that even after reducing the number of variables, the essential
# patterns of the data are still there and that the reduced model might be enough to
# 'explain' the data. 


# *This can be visualize using the following plots, where the closer an arrow is to
# the edge of the circle, the stronger its correlation with the principal components 
# (and the closer it is to the origin, the weaker the correlation). Arrows going to 
# the right, show that the variables are positively correlated with the first component, 
# while arrows going to the left, indicate negative correlation. On the other hand, 
# arrows going up show variables that are positively correlated with the second component, 
# while arrows going down, show negative corrrelation.

var_all <- plot(pca_all,choix="var") 
var_mean <- plot(pca_mean,choix="var") 

var_all + var_mean # Visualize them side by side
# As we can see the directions and length of the arrows are very similar in both cases:

# Radius, perimeter and area are pointing right and down. Strong positive correlation, 
# 0.8/0.9, with the first component and moderate negative correlation, -0.4/-0.5, with the
# second component. It makes sense that the three of them are close to each other since
# they are highly related between them.
# *In the case of smoothness and symmetry, even though they are not strongly correlated,
# their arrows are very similar. This could mean that they are linked through an 
# underlying pattern in the data or that they have a similar relationship with different
# variables.

# Concave points mean is pointing to the right with very little variation in the y axis, 
# and that is way the correlation with the first component is very high, 0.95, and 
# almost 0, with the second one.

# Finally, the fractal dimension mean is pointing up and just a bit to the right. This
# makes the correlation with the first component fairly low, 0.2, and the correlation
# with the second component very strong, 0.9.

# This just confirms the analysis done with the numerical values.

# *We have seen this as well, but is the same concept/idea (just to mention it):
# For a variable cos2 is the square of the correlation
(pca_all$var$cor)^2 #=cos2 for variables
(pca_mean$var$cor)^2 #=cos2 for variables

#### Duality

# Duality is for checking the relation between a variable and a specific individual:

    # When an individual point is located in the direction of a variable arrow, 
    # the individual has a high value on that variable. If it is in the opposite direction,
    # it will have a low value. 

    # The distance is also important: the farther along the line an individual is, 
    # the larger their value for that variable and viceversa.

# variance than the first component of the full model, it makes sense that their values are closer 
# to 1 (same thing with the second component). Moreover, in both cases as the first 
# component explains more percentage of variance than the second component (that is why
# they are first and second components respectively), its values are closer to 1.

# PCA: PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS AND DIAGNOSIS
###################################

# Finally, we can't forget that we are analysing a dataset related to cancer, so we will
# check if the first two components have somehow separate cancer diagnosis (benign 
# and malign):

# Plot PCA individuals colored by diagnosis
fviz_pca_ind(pca_mean, 
             col.ind = diagnosis, 
             palette = c("blue", "red"),  # Malignant=red, Benign=blue
             legend.title = "Diagnosis",
             title = "PCA: Individuals Colored by Diagnosis (Mean Variables)") +
  theme_minimal()

# While component 2 doesn't seem to make a lof of difference regarding the diagnosis, we 
# can see that there is a clear separation between bening and maling diagnosis in the first 
# component: bening diagnosis are clearly related to low (negative) values of component 1.
# This makes sense, since the first component is highly correlated to variables such as
# radius or perimeter, which we already saw (during the descriptive analysis) that are 
# good indicators of the diagnosis (high radius was related to malign tumours).


# We will confirm this by getting the mean values of the coordinates by diagnosis:

# We create a dataframe with coordinates and diagnosis
pca_data <- data.frame(
  PC1 = pca_mean$ind$coord[, 1],
  PC2 = pca_mean$ind$coord[, 2],
  Diagnosis = diagnosis
)

# We filter the dataset to get separate variables
benign_coords <- pca_data %>% filter(Diagnosis == "B")
malign_coords <- pca_data %>% filter(Diagnosis == "M")

# We get the mean values for the first component
mean(benign_coords$PC1)
mean(malign_coords$PC1)

# We get the mean values for the second component
mean(benign_coords$PC2)
mean(malign_coords$PC2)

# As we can see, the difference is much greater in the first component.


# We can even check this difference with a violin plot:

# Violin plot for first component
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = PC1, fill = diagnosis)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of PC1 by Diagnosis")

# Violin plot for second component
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = diagnosis, y = PC2, fill = diagnosis)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of PC2 by Diagnosis")

# The difference is clear in this case as well


# Finally, to confirm this using an statistical test, we will perform an ANOVA test using 
# the function aov() (not anova()), to see whether there is a significant difference in 
# the variation within the groups and between the groups.

# Fit the ANOVA model with the first component
model_aov <- aov(PC1 ~ diagnosis, data = pca_data)

# Check overall significance
anova_result <- summary(model_aov)
p_value <- anova_result[[1]]$"Pr(>F)"[1]
p_value # The p-value is 3.134668e-120, confirming that the is a significant difference 
# between the PC1 for each diagnosis group.

# Fit the ANOVA model with the second component
model_aov2 <- aov(PC2 ~ diagnosis, data = pca_data)

# Check overall significance
anova_result2 <- summary(model_aov2)
p_value2 <- anova_result2[[1]]$"Pr(>F)"[1]
p_value2 # The p-value is 0.0008018806, confirming that the is a significant difference 
# between the PC2 for each diagnosis group.

# Although both statistical tests confirm that there is a difference between the
# diagnosis group in both PC1 and PC2, the p-values show that in the case of PC1 this
# difference is much bigger.
